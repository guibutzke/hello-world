# hello-world

Hello everyone!
Guilherme here, from Brazil, I'm learning how to use GitHub correct way.

I hope that GitHub can help me to organize my files keeping a little documentation about changes that I or another user made.

I'm interested on Business Intelligence, Business Analytics, Data Science, R Language, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence applied on data.

That's it!
